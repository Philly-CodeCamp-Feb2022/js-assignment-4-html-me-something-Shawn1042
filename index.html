      <h2>Why I am obsessed with anime!</h2>
      <p>Ever since I branched out of watching just Dragon Ball, I've grown
         too love anime even more! The first anime I watched after Dragon Ball Super, was
         Hunter x Hunter! I loved the animation, characters, the story-telling, the arcs, and many more!
         <br>
         This section isn't just about telling you that I love Hunter x Hunter, It's about the different stories and 
         multiple factors as to why I like anime in general, Hunter x Hunter was a great example, I know :)
