     <h2>Hunter x Hunter!</h2>
     <br>
     <p>I used to love watching anime as a kid, then video games took over my life, and wellll 
         I took a little hiatus from watching anime, try 10 years. I didnt even know Dragon Ball Super was a thing until 2019, yeah... I know.
         Ever since I branched out of watching just Dragon Ball in late 2019 after I finished Super, I watched
        Hunter x Hunter!Hunter x Hunter is my 2nd favorite anime of all time, behind Attack on Titan(goat)! <br>
        What I loved about Hunter x Hunter; the animation, characters, the story-telling, the arcs, and the character development in
        Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and even Leorio! I also loved the backgrounds of every character, especially Kurapika. Hunter x Hunter had it all,
        dispense, happy, cliffhanging, detective, exciting and sad moments, and most of all, a great story. 
        <br>
        This section isn't just about telling you that I love Hunter x Hunter, It's about the different stories and 
        multiple factors as to why I like anime in general, Hunter x Hunter was a great example, I know :)

         <br>
         <p><em>Attack on Titan</em> is my favorite anime! I will always
       recommend that everyone and anyone, watch this anime! Why do I love Attack on Titan so much you might ask? Well, 
   the music is amazing, the animation is great, the world building is extremely unique, 
   the characters are incredibly interesting, and I could go on and on for days. What I love the most about Attack on Titan
is that every character is important and has a purpose, I also value the suspense and cliffhangers 
at the end of each episode! <br> The MC(main character) is also another reason why I love Attack on Titan, Eren Yeager's character 
development has been one of my favorites. He's also not a basic anime character either, 
he explains his ideals and actions and he is also incredibly intelligent. Eren was able to manipulate the entire world,
especiallypeople closets to him. I also thoroughly enjoyed every single second of every single season, everything
had a meaning behind it, there was always something planned, and always adversity! I recommend you go watch it! 10/10!</p>

             <header><h2>My Hero Academia!</h2></header>
             <p>My Hero Academia is my favorite new gen anime! This anime is about a boy named Izuku Midoriya,
                  who lives in a world where everyone has powers(they call it quirks), but he is born with none! 
                 I mlove this anime because is depicts a new super hero new gen! 
                 The world building is fsily basic, but plays a huge part in the story, 
                 the characters are very interesting(especiallythe main villain named Shigaraki), the 
                 music is very very good, the arcs are incredible, <br>
                 lots of funny moments, the main villain has turned into my favorite villain of all time, so far.
                 The character development is also very impressive, THE CHARACTER DESIGNS ARE EXTREMELY GREAT, but the biggest thing that gravitates me to 
                 My Hero Academia are the villains! The villans in My Hero Academia are S tier(top tier), in my opinion of course.
                Each villain has a unique and dark background, utlizied in different ways,and each have a very unique power(quirk). <br>
               I also thoroughly enjoy the story as a whole, the boy who was born without any powers, climbing his way to the top, to become
               the number 1 and most reliable hero in the world! 9.5/10, I recommend! </p>
