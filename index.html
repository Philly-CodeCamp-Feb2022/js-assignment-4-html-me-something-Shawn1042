     <h2>Hunter x Hunter!</h2>
     <br>
     <p>I used to love watching anime as a kid, then video games took over my life, and wellll 
         I took a little hiatus from watching anime, try 10 years. I didnt even know Dragon Ball Super was a thing until 2019, yeah... I know.
         Ever since I branched out of watching just Dragon Ball in late 2019 after I finished Super, I watched
        Hunter x Hunter!Hunter x Hunter is my 2nd favorite anime of all time, behind Attack on Titan(goat)! <br>
        What I loved about Hunter x Hunter; the animation, characters, the story-telling, the arcs, and the character development in
        Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and even Leorio! I also loved the backgrounds of every character, especially Kurapika. Hunter x Hunter had it all,
        dispense, happy, cliffhanging, detective, exciting and sad moments, and most of all, a great story. 
        <br>
        This section isn't just about telling you that I love Hunter x Hunter, It's about the different stories and 
        multiple factors as to why I like anime in general, Hunter x Hunter was a great example, I know :)
